LUTI-Health-GM. Land use-transport interaction (LUTI) simulation for Greater Manchester focusing on health (non-communicable disease) and health inequality.
The development of this pilot model is funded by the Population Health Agent-based Simulation nEtwork (PHASE), a network funded by the UK Prevention Research Partnership (UKPRP).
This study was conducted with collaborators at University of Reading and Manchester.
